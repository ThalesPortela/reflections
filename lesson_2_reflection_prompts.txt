What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	Git metadata is created and stored in .git folder. No commits are created
	and no files are tracked at this time.
	You need to initialize git so it can convert in a repository and track
	files history via commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area differs from working directory because it groups only the
	changes that will be commited in sequence. It offers the opportunity
	to make logical commits from a bunch a of modifications in the working
	directory.
	On the other hand, repository is made of commited changes. Repository will just
	be updated once staging area modifications to be commited.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
